# magneto
Basic 2D graphics library for rust.

**Please note:**
* Magneto requires SDL2.0 development libraries to run.
Please refer to [the rust-sdl2 page](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) for specific instructions to install for your operating system.
* Magneto is still in very early development. Not all functionalities may operate as expected.

Magneto aims to provide a very simple rendering and window solution for you to build your own engine around.

**Future Plans**:
+ Text Rendering
+ Batch Rendering
+ Versatile shader and texture objects
+ Wrapper for SDL2 events
